# PegasusExportPlugin
Plugin for launchbox to export to pegasus format
#### Changes
Didn't like the media from launchbox so i added a external media folder and the option to change the backslash (I use Pegasus on Android). Now you can scrape your own media from something like *SkraperUI*. As long as you name the media folders like the assets names (boxFront, marquee, logo, video, etc) you should be good. I advise you to use the options in the image below to use one media folder for all collections. --metadata files can have assets in other folders but i canÂ´t get the file to work that way. So if you use playlists like i do, you gonna have duplicate game files.
